Fall 2020 - Computational Medicine course project - Predictive Modeling of Patient Mortality

### Summary
This project uses modeling to predict mortality in hospital patients. It compares the results of multiple classifiers (Random Forest, Decision Tree, Ridge Classifier) and experiments with techniques for handling missing / imbalanced data (imputation, class weighting, oversampling).

Analysis was performed using Jupyter Notebook and Python.
